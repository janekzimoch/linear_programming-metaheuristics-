# Linear programming - Manufacturing Systems (Portfolio repository)
This repository contains samples of linear programming code I wrote for Manufacturing Systems module at University of Bristol in 2019.
My final coursework report is also attached, where I identify and evaluate the best sub-optimal sequence of manufacturing processes to optimise job flow through a complex manufacturing line.
